## About Vale, styles, and rules

* [Vale is a syntax-aware linter for prose.](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale)
* [The Vale project provides a collection of optional and useful _styles_](https://github.com/errata-ai/styles), including:
  * [Microsoft](https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft) - An implementation of the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).
  * [Google](https://github.com/errata-ai/Google) - An implementation of the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/). 
* Each style is a collection of _rules_. And each rule is defined by a single `.yml` file.
* You can customize rules in an existing style to meet your needs. 
* You can also write new rules and create a style from them.
