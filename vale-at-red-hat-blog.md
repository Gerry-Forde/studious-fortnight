# Vale at Red Hat Blog

## 19. May, 7:37 AM, Wednesday

Today, I added a _GitHub action_ to run Vale against this repo. The action consists of a `.github/workflows/main.yml` file. For now, the action is configured to check new and modified files, not all files in this repo. To see the actions, look at this repo in GitHub and click the Actions tab.

I also added "repo" to `.vale/styles/Vocab/Che/accept.txt`.

Rolfe: This weekend, I merged many updates into the studious-fortnight repo. These included:
- Removing the previous `/styles` folder and `.vale.ini` file.
- Adding the `.vale` styles folder and `.vale.ini` that Fabrice and Yana developed for the Che eclipse documentation project.
- Updating and expanding `README.md` with new information to help you get started with using Vale.
- Adding a "Troubleshooting common errors" topic to help newcomers identify and correct common issues.

I'm also adding this blog page.
